Version .41 was tested against ActiveState Perl 5.6.1.

First of all, for win32 perl, you do not use CPAN. ActiveState has its
own installer called "ppm" This is run from the command prompt. Within ppm,
it behaves just like CPAN for installing perl modules.

Required modules for basic ussage of the bot are as follows:

Net::IRC
DBI
DBD::mysql
DB_File

Some plugins require their own specific modules, some are not available
for ActiveState Perl.


To get the bot running by itself, I needed to alter the code of d.pl in
the following ways:


Comment out the entire contents of fetch_mg2_users
Comment out the alarm(); functions.
Comment out the add_sheduled_even line in init_connection
Comment out the dbugr funtion at the end of the file

Obviously, the bot name, server, db info, etc must be altered.

The core plugins work, change_shorthand, learn, unlearn, status, uptime, 
listplugins. I will write updates here as more plugins are found to be 
supported.

The plugin mem doesnt work as of now.
