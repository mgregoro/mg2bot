writing an mg2bot plugin if you know perl and Net::IRC is easy!

we hand you an $event and an $ic object.. and then you can do
whatever you want with it.

the format looks like this

Note:
the header must look exactly like this.. no spaces in anything at all.  the version
numbers must be valid numbers!!! 


the file needs to begin like this:

;;mg2bot plugin file;;
dv:req'd_mg2bot_version_number
v:vnumber
c:private or public
n:name_of_plugin
{
# then code can follow
# keep in mind it has to be within the curly braces.. and they are manditory
# UNPACK YOUR VARS
    my ($irc, $event, $args) = @_;
    $irc->privmsg("$event->nick", "Thanks for telling me $args");
# easy enough eh ;) ask if you have any questions
}
