this is a text file containing notes for my new advanced factfinding
parser that will be a sexy plugin maybe one day.  this will be used to
collect data from multiple sources similarily to googlism, but will be
far more advanced.  We will take more data in, and return queries more
reliably than googlism.   Anyways.  I'm going to write out a few
sentences below to try and find a good harvesting algorithm.

The cats are so cuddly.

(?the?) cats = subject

questions (all legal):

+cats <- shorthand question
mg2bot, cats? <- longhand question
+cat <- shorthand question
mg2bot, cat? <- longhand question

acceptable answers:

the cats are so cuddly.
they are so cuddly. 
cats are so cuddly. 

How to parse this.. 

We know that the word after "the" is typically a noun, and will want to
be recorded as such.  Same goes for "a".  So we can parse for sentences
or statements first.

if ($string !~ /\./) {
    # if there are no periods, treat the string as one statement.
    if ($string =~ /^(the|a)\s(\w+)\s(\w+)\s([\w\s]+)/) {
        # if the string starts with the or a, extract the first word
        # then extract the second word, and finally the rest of the
        # sentence.
        my $subject = $2;
        my $are = $3;
        my $definition = $4;
    }
}
